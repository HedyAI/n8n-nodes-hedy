## 📊 Data Structures

### Session Object
```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "title": "Team Standup",
  "startTime": "2024-01-10T10:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z",
  "duration": 1800,
  "session_type": "meeting",
  "transcript": "Full transcript...",
  "cleaned_transcript": "AI-cleaned transcript...",
  "cleaned_at": "2024-01-10T11:00:00Z",
  "conversations": [...],
  "meeting_minutes": "Meeting notes...",
  "recap": "Summary...",
  "session_notes": "[{\"insert\":\"Key takeaway\\n\"}]",
  "user_todos": [...],
  "highlights": [...],
  "topic": {...}
}
```

> **Note:** `cleaned_transcript` and `cleaned_at` are `null` when the transcript has not yet been cleaned. `session_notes` contains rich text in Parchment JSON (Delta) format.

### Highlight Object
```json
{
  "highlightId": "high_xyz789",
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-10T10:15:00Z",
  "timeIndex": 900000,
  "title": "Key Decision",
  "rawQuote": "Original quote...",
  "cleanedQuote": "Cleaned quote...",
  "mainIdea": "Core concept...",
  "aiInsight": "Analysis..."
}
```

> **Note:** The list endpoint (`Get Many`) returns summary fields only (`highlightId`, `sessionId`, `timestamp`, `title`). The detail endpoint (`Get`) returns all fields.

### Todo Object
```json
{
  "id": "todo_123",
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "text": "Follow up with marketing team",
  "dueDate": "2024-01-15",
  "completed": false,
  "topic": {...}
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Webhook Limits
- Maximum of 50 webhooks per Hedy account
- Webhooks must use HTTPS URLs
- Each webhook receives a unique signing secret for security

### Pagination
- Default page size: 50 items
- Maximum page size: 100 items
- Supports cursor-based pagination for large datasets

### Rate Limiting
The API follows standard rate limiting practices. If you encounter rate limit errors, implement exponential backoff in your workflows.

## 🔒 Security

### Webhook Signature Verification
All webhooks include an `X-Hedy-Signature` header for verification:

1. The signature is an HMAC SHA-256 hash of the request body
2. Each webhook has a unique signing secret
3. Signature verification is disabled by default (enable in Options when signing secrets are available)

### API Key Security
- Never share your API key publicly
- Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Use n8n's built-in credential encryption
- Keys can be revoked instantly from the Hedy dashboard

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Webhook Registration Fails**
- Ensure your n8n instance uses HTTPS
- Check you haven't exceeded the 50 webhook limit
- Verify your API key has the necessary permissions

**No Data Returned**
- Verify the resource ID exists
- Check your API key is valid
- Ensure you have access to the requested resource

**Signature Verification Fails**
- Don't modify webhook payloads
- Ensure signature verification is using the correct secret
- Check for clock skew between servers
